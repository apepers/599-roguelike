##Lightsaber
Obi-Wan: I have something here for you. Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn't allow it.
He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some damn fool idealistic crusade like your father did.

Luke: What is it?

Obi-Wan: Your father's light saber. This is the weapon of a Jedi Knight. Not as clumsy or random as a blaster; an elegant weapon for a 
more civilized age. For over a thousand generations, the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic. 
Before the dark times... before the Empire.
