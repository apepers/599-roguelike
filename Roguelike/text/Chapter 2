You head down into what appears to be the main living quarters. Broken
dishes, beds, and seemingly incomprehensible objects that seem to have 
no use.

A strange draft of radiation fills the room. In fact the strange sensation 
is both warm and cold. You can't help but feel that there is always some 
hope of saving at least one of your crew members. And yet no one here 
seems to be capable speak anything comprehensible other than the roars of 
the monsters you've encountered. You find a strange note that interrupts 
your thought:

"I KNOW A WAY OUT, FIND ME IN THE SHIPS BRIDGE". The hand writing eerily 
seems like one of your lower ranked officer Styx. Finally! A sign of life. 

At least you can begin to forget the loss of your doctor...
