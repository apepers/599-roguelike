Finally, you reach the bridge. You see the traitor laughing 
menacingly at you. Styx, that bastard. Before he even has a 
chance to speak, you fire your EMP pistol to disable his 
rifle. Then he operates a button on the captain's deck and 
the room begins to fill with a hoard of monsters. In a vain 
attempt to overpower you the monsters overtake him as you 
fend for yourself. He is gruesomely torn to pieces since 
you ruined the only chance he had to defend himself. 

You are left to defend yourself, knowing that you are the
last of your crew...
