Finally, you reach the bridge. You see the traitor laughing 
menacingly at you. Styx, that bastard. As you think of how
to reach him, he operates a button on the captain's deck and 
the room begins to fill with a hoard of monsters. But as he 
moves to draw his rifle, a giant ant scales the back of the deck
and bisects him with its powerful jaws. 

Your final crew member devoured by his own monsters, you 
are left to fend for yourself...
