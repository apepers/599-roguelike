Cold, very cold. The room is covered in frost from the ceiling to 
the floor. You activate your heat generator. Massive icebergs 
float in the severed space outside. They float so closely the the 
window, and yet they have no momentum. Your first mate stands 
there in his signature rifle pose behind coolant pipe. He's 
missing his left arm and he appears to be aiming in a seemingly 
random direction in the room. You eerily see the anger in his 
face, as if he was trying to attack something.

You find that his air pump has been fried. This could have only
been broken by an high powered Gamma-Burster rifle, a standard 
weapon employed by your ship's crew. 

You grip your fist at the thought... could it be?

Pressing on...
