Cautiously heading down the stairs, the window appears to be severed in seemingly 
random directions. Each section had an entirely different perspective on
the wasteland that you call a space station. You keep tapping on your radio's 
button hoping for someone to hear your call.

You hear a scream from your radio! You rush down the remaining stairs and spot one of your 
doctors stuck in a closing door. Running over to help the only crew member you 
saw since the accident, you try to pull her out of the door. She screams in agony 
as you pull her. You pull and pull as hard as you can. 

She loses her breath and falls flat on the floor forming a pool of blood 
under her lifeless body. A shadow quickly runs down the corridor as it 
carries on the remains of her legs. Bang! You attempt to shoot the shadow 
but fail. 

You mourn for her loss, but can't help but think there must be other members that 
need your help. 

Time to move on...
