Hot, very hot. The reactors in this room are still running. Molten lava 
and volcanic rocks streak the seemingly endless space. You turn on the 
AC in your suit and as you walk around the room. You discover a pile of 
bodies. Your crew...

You shift the bodies and find no trace of weapons or utilities. All of 
the crew members has had their air regenerators fried. Only the high 
powered Gamma-burst rifle could have penetrated the pump and burnt out
the shielded circuits. A weapon that is employed by all officers. Yet 
there were no open wounds or cuts in their suits... 

There was no way any of the monsters on this ship could have murdered 
your crew unless... 

You tremble at the thought...

Moving on...
