It is the year 4040X, fuel trade has hit an all time high and the Galactic 
Trade Federation has put a bounty of $1 billion zetos for the first person 
to develop an alternative to black matter fuel. 

You and your space crew find a strange energy reading not previously 
detected before in a small solar system in the Chronos sector of the 
galaxy. Perhaps a new source of fuel could have already been discovered 
by found by some advanced civilization. You head to the solar system to 
investigate. 

Then you find a strange looking space station amidst a cluster of 
asteroids. As you approach the station, corpses of wrecked space ships 
litter the the dwarf class star. Suddenly, your first mate reports that 
you’ve lost contact with the nearest space beacon. Then you hear a huge 
explosion from the engine room on your ship. The ship begins to sever 
through holes in space. Your crew pop in and out of existence, what seems 
to be your first mate could very well be the back of your head.

Then a bright flash of light knocks you out of consciousness.

You find yourself on an unfamiliar floor alone. You hear the screams of 
your crew. You’re hungry and all you have with you are your fists and your 
wits. 

Find your crew and escape this wretched space station!
